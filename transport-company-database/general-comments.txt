I have chosen not to use the type 'serial'. The reason is https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don't_Do_This#Don.27t_use_serial.
I have chosen to use the snake case for all names and identifiers, and similar.
I have chosen to write all SQL and PostgreSQL commands in lowercase.
I have chosen to use the type "interval" for columns related to either date, time, or both. I think it is the most flexible type in this case. Having one type for this use case shall let avoid any problems with comparing values. One may add additional restrictions if needed, like "interval day".
