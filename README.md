# SQL and PostgreSQL learning
A blog documenting me learning of SQL and PostgreSQL

## 14 to 17 Oct, 2024 (days 1 to 4)

Lacking a job too long, I decided to go back to computer science. I am to refresh me SQL basics and learn the basics of PostgreSQL. I have allotted 30 days for this. That means that the last day shall be 13 Nov, 2024. Then, on 14 Nov, 2024, here on the blog I will summarize what I have learnt.

During the first 4 days I have mainly red the Wikipedia article about SQL and some questions on Stack Overflow about "null." I have installed PostgreSQL. I have written a [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7252380581676601344-ymVo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) about the commitment. I have decided to start this blog. I have decided to start reading the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/index.html), the reasons being, it is the official documentation, and it contains a tutorial early on. I have prepared a simple model of a database, which I am planning to transform into a database, and it then should accompany me theoretical learning.
